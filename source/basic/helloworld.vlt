To print Hello World using Velato:
   1. Understand Velato Basics:
    Velato is a programming language where code is written as MIDI music. The instructions are encoded using the intervals between musical notes.

   2. Set Up the Tools:
    To work with Velato, you need:
        - A MIDI editor (e.g., MuseScore, FL Studio, LMMS) to compose the music.
        - A Velato interpreter (e.g., one available on GitHub) to execute the MIDI as a program.
          Compose the Music:

   3. Start with a reference note (e.g., C4).
    Use specific note intervals to encode commands. For example:
        - A certain interval might encode the "Print" command.
        - Follow it with intervals that represent the string "Hello, World!" in ASCII format.
        - Save and Run the MIDI File:

    4. Save your composition as a MIDI file.
        - Open the file in the Velato interpreter.
        - Run the program, and it will print "Hello, World!".
        - Example for a MIDI File
        - To print "Hello, World!", a MIDI file might encode:

    - Starting reference note: C4.
    - Command notes: E4 → G4 → A4, which would translate to:
    - Print command.
    String "Hello, World!".
