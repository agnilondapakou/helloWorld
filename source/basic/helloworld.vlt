1. Understand Velato Basics:
Velato is a programming language where code is written as MIDI music. The instructions are encoded using the intervals between musical notes.

2. Set Up the Tools:
To work with Velato, you need:
    - A MIDI editor (e.g., MuseScore, FL Studio, LMMS) to compose the music.
    - A Velato interpreter (e.g., one available on GitHub) to execute the MIDI as a program.
        Compose the Music:

3. Start with a reference note (e.g., C4).
Use specific note intervals to encode commands. For example:
    - A certain interval might encode the "Print" command.
    - Follow it with intervals that represent the string "Hello, World!" in ASCII format.
    - Save and Run the MIDI File:

4. Save your composition as a MIDI file.
    - Open the file in the Velato interpreter.
    - Run the program, and it will print "Hello, World!".
    - Example for a MIDI File
    - To print "Hello, World!", a MIDI file might encode:

- Starting reference note: C4.
- Command notes: E4 → G4 → A4, which would translate to:
- Print command.
String "Hello, World!".
